# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code ðŸŽ„
Working through problems for the various [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) events.

Each year has its own dedicated subfolder within this project :
- [2023](2023), in [Go](https://go.dev/)

This repo is still very much a work in progress and will regularly be updated to include new puzzle solutions and refactoring as I learn more about the language.
